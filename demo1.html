            This is a schematic diagram of a strato volcano, intended to illustrate the different layers of different
            materials that comprise them. The purple colors are meant to represent ash layers, either the products of
            fall-out from big eruption clouds or the products of pyroclastic flows. Notice that these ash layers tend to be
            thin but widespread. The orange colors represent lava flows, and note that some of them have cinder cones
            associated with them at the vent. The green colors are meant to represent lava domes, and notice that they do
            not flow very far. Each eruption, regardless of what it produces, is fed from the magma chamber by a dike. Most
            dikes come up through the center of the volcano and therefore most eruptions occur from at or near the summit.
            However, some dikes head off sideways to feed eruptions on the flanks.
